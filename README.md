# Forex-Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Transformer-and-Time-Embeddings

This repository contains the code for the Project "Forex Stock Price Prediction using Transformers" written in Tensorflow 2.9.1.

## About the Project

The foreign exchange (Forex) market is a global decentralized market for the trading of currencies. It is one of the largest financial markets in the world, with an average daily trading volume of over $5 trillion. Predicting the price movements of Forex markets is a challenging task, as these markets are affected by a variety of factors, including economic and political events, interest rates, and global news. In recent years, deep neural networks have shown great potential in predicting stock market prices. In this report, I explore the use of transformer-based deep neural networks for Forex stock market price prediction. I use the Transformer-XL architecture, which is a variant of the Transformer architecture that is designed to handle long sequences. I also use time embeddings to encode the time information of the input data.
